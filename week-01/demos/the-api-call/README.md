# Lecture 3 — calling the LLM

Four ways to make the same call. Two transports (raw `curl` and the Python
SDK), against two OpenAI endpoints (the classic **Chat Completions** API and
the newer **Responses** API). The point of the lecture: it is all JSON over
HTTP, and one wire format covers every provider.

```
chat-completions/   the classic endpoint  (/v1/chat/completions)
  curl.sh             raw HTTP, no SDK
  call.py             the same call via the openai SDK
responses/          the newer endpoint    (/v1/responses)
  curl.sh             raw HTTP, no SDK
  call.py             the same call via the openai SDK
```

## Run it

Set your key once:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."        # or put it in a .env (see .env.example)
```

Raw HTTP — nothing but `curl`:

```bash
bash chat-completions/curl.sh
bash responses/curl.sh
```

Python — install the SDK first:

```bash
pip install openai
python chat-completions/call.py
python responses/call.py
```

## Chat Completions vs Responses

| | Chat Completions | Responses |
|---|---|---|
| endpoint | `/v1/chat/completions` | `/v1/responses` |
| input | `messages: [...]` | `input` (+ `instructions`) |
| output | `choices[0].message.content` | `output_text` |
| status | the de-facto standard everyone speaks | OpenAI's newer, simpler surface |

Chat Completions is the format every other provider copied, so it is what you
target for portability. Responses is OpenAI's own newer endpoint — cleaner, but
not (yet) universal.

## Same wire, different substrate

The Chat Completions shape is not OpenAI-only. Point the same Python code at a
different `base_url` and it calls a different machine:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# your laptop, via Ollama — no key, no money, no internet
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1", api_key="ollama")
```

Same client, same call, same JSON. The substrate is replaceable; the interface
is portable.
